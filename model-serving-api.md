# Scentience Model Serving API

---

### Serving Edge Models
Each Scentience device is equipped with its own AI models.
Additionally, the Scentience iOS and Android apps each contain the embedded Scentience [Olfaction Vision Language Models](https://scentience.github.io/docs-api/model-cards).
These models are served without fees and can be called at will, and specifically designed for fast inference for real-time robotics applications. 
Running at the edge also preserves user privacy, ensuring any data from which Scentience inference occurs remains on the user-owned device.

The only requirements to leverage these models is a Scentience device - no API keys are required for edge models.
