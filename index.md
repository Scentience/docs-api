# <img src="https://scentience.github.io/docs-api/assets/logo.png" style="width:3%"> Scentience APIs
The Scentience APIs provide real-time communication between Scentience devices, the Scentience mobile app, Scentience AI models, and other robots or olfactory-enabled systems.
Enabled to interface with nearly any application and programming language, this API enables seamless exchange of olfactory information over several lightweight standard bidirectional communication protocols.


**Features**
- Real-time Communication – Stream data from olfactory devices with minimal latency.
- Robot Integration – Allow robots and IoT devices to access olfactory information.
- App Relay – The Scentience app can act as a hub, relaying olfactory signals between devices.
- Lightweight & Efficient – Built with standard software development tools like GCD, GATT, REST, web sockets, and more for high performance and scalability.
- Cross-Platform Ready – Any capable connection through conventional cloud, application, or firmware languages (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.).
