# Scentience APIs
The Scentience APIs provide real-time communication between Scentience devices, the Scentience mobile app, Scentience AI models, and other robots or olfactory-enabled systems.
Enabled to interface with nearly any application and programming language, this API enables seamless exchange of olfactory information over several lightweight standard bidirectional communication protocols.

Scentience offers 4 APIs:
- **[Sockets API](https://scentience.github.io/docs-api/sockets-api)**: Communicate over web socket connections to olfactory devices, robots, or other peripherals.
- **[UAV Sockets API](https://scentience.github.io/docs-api/sockets-uav-api) A derivative of the Sockets API purposed specifically for drone and UAV communication for [olfactory inertial odometry](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078037).
- **[Bluetooth API](https://scentience.github.io/docs-api/ble-api)**: Quickly stream real-time communication from olfactory sensors to other nearby devices or robotic sensors.
- **[AI Model API](https://scentience.github.io/docs-api/model-cards)**: Get on-demand inference from Scentience AI models being served in the cloud.


<!-- **Features**
- Real-time Communication – Stream data from olfactory devices with minimal latency.
- Robot Integration – Allow robots and IoT devices to access olfactory information.
- App Relay – The Scentience app can act as a hub, relaying olfactory signals between devices.
- Lightweight & Efficient – Built with standard software development tools like GCD, GATT, REST, web sockets, and more for high performance and scalability.
- Cross-Platform Ready – Any capable connection through conventional cloud, application, or firmware languages (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.). -->
